Combining Full-Shape and BAO Analyses of Galaxy Power Spectra to Constrain Cosmology
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most analyses of galaxy surveys rely on extracting information from the galaxy power spectrum, either by looking at the position of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) peaks, or the broadband Full Shape (FS). BAO analyses are assisted by *reconstruction* of the galaxy density field, first proposed in [Eisenstein et al. 2006](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604362), which effectively 'undoes' the effects of long wavelength displacements, shifting galaxies closer to their Lagrangian-space positions. Whilst this yields a sharper BAO peak, the broadband shape is difficult to model perturbatively, thus a full-shape analysis of reconstructed spectra is infeasible. In [Philcox et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04035), we perform a joint analysis of pre- and post-reconstruction galaxy power spectra, extracting geometric Alcock-Paczynski parameters from the BAO peaks of the reconstructed power spectrum and using this to inform an FS analysis of the unreconstructed spectrum via a joint covariance matrix. We additionally introduce a new method for obtaining constraints from reconstructed spectra based on a correlated theoretical error, which is shown to be simple, robust, and applicable to any flavor of density-field reconstruction.

This is applied to the galaxy power spectrum multipoles from the final data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), allowing us to place strong constraints on cosmology without any information from the CMB. Using only a single prior on the current baryon density from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), we can place 1.6% constraints on the Hubble parameter H0, with a significant sharpening given by including the BAO data. This represents one of the strongest constraints on H0 from galaxy surveys alone. Placing an additional Planck prior on the spectral slope tightens this to 1%. We further consider combination of the BAO, FS and Planck datasets; we find that the improved precision is sourced primarily from degeneracy breaking, with the addition of BAO data not strongly narrowing the contours.

Measuring the Small-Scale Galaxy Power Spectrum and Bispectrum
--------------------------------------------------------

Understanding galaxy clustering statistics, such as the power spectrum and bispectrum, can give us an array of information, both on cosmology and galaxy formation. Conventional methods to measure these use Fast Fourier Transforms, which are optimal on large-scales, but require large computation times on small scales, and suffer from effects such as aliasing and shot-noise. In [Philcox & Eisenstein 2019b](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01010), we introduce [HIPSTER](https://Hipster.readthedocs.io), a suite of new estimators for computing small-scale power spectra and bispectra in *configuration space* via weighted pair and triple counts, with no explicit use of Fourier transforms. These fully account for the survey window function, and do not include aliasing, shot-noise or discretization artifacts. Unlike conventional Fourier-transform-based approaches, our algorithm becomes more efficient on small scales (since a smaller pair-count truncation may be used), thus we may efficiently estimate spectra across k-space by coupling this method with standard techniques. The utility of the method is shown by application to BOSS DR12 simulations to compute the high-k power spectrum and its covariance, which is in good agreement with that from our theoretical model. Computing configuration- and Fourier-space statistics in the same manner allows us to consider joint analyses, which can place stronger bounds on cosmological parameters.

Computing Galaxy Correlation Function Covariances
----------------------------------------

In order to extract information from large cosmological surveys, we require robust statistics, as well as accurate estimates of their covariance matrices. In practice, this is difficult, since covariance matrices have non-trivial dependencies on the survey window function, which can be highly anisotropic, thus covariances are normally computed from a large suite of simulations, which is highly computationally expensive. In [Philcox et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11070), we introduce [RascalC](https://RascalC.readthedocs.io), a C++ code for estimating the covariance matrices of large scale two-point correlation function (2PCF) covariances in arbitrary survey geometries. This runs around 10,000 times faster than previous codes, computing finely binned covariances in a fraction of the time required with mocks. As in previous works ([O'Connell & Eisenstein 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05978.pdf), [O'Connell et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01740.pdf)), we include the effects of non-Gaussianity via a small rescaling of shot-noise in the theoretical model, which has been shown to work well in practice. In addition, the resulting free parameter can be computed from the data itself, via jackknifing.

In most modern analyses of galaxy correlation functions, information is included from statistics beyond the isotropic 2PCF monopole. In particular, angular information informs us about redshift-space-distortions, and gravitational non-linearities (and inflation) source a non-zero three-point correlation function. In [Philcox & Eisenstein 2019a](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04764), we extend our covariance matrix estimators to include Legendre multipoles of the 2PCF and the 3PCF, requiring numerical integration over an 18-dimensional space, made possible through the fast RascalC algorithm and importance sampling. This code has been publicly released, and is shown to be accurate, reducing covariance computation time from CPU-decades to a matter of hours.

Inferring Galactic Parameters from Stellar Chemical Abundances
---------------------------------------------------------------

To understand galactic physics and create realistic hydrodynamical simulations, we require accurate knowledge of underlying physical parameters in the Galaxy, such as the slope of the initial mass function (IMF) and the frequency of Type Ia supernovae. An intriguing way in which to constrain these parameters is by looking at the chemical abundances of stars; these trace the composition of the interstellar medium, and are intrinsically related to the abundance of stars of different types. In the [Chempy](https://github.com/oliverphilcox/ChempyMulti) project ([Rybizki et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08729)), a simple galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model was constructed which allowed for parameter estimates to be performed in a Bayesian framework, primarily using the set of proto-stellar abundances. In [Philcox & Rybizki 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00812.pdf), this was extended to include multiple stars, incorporating modern statistical methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and neural networks. Using simulated data from IllustrisTNG, we demonstrate the utility of this method for obtaining parameter constraints, which grow tighter as more stars are included, and are competitive with other methods, including star counts.

A key hyperparameter in these analyses is the set of nucleosynthetic yields which determine the elemental output of stellar processes such as supernovae and asymptotic giant branch stars, and, in [Philcox & Rybizki 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00812.pdf), this was shown to have a non-negligible bias on the galactic parameter estimates. To distinguish between the variety of yield tables available, we present a scoring system in [Philcox et al. 2018a](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05686) (using Bayesian evidence ratios and cross-validation), based on the ability of a yield table to reproduce proto-solar abundances when used inside our GCE model. An important application of this is to allow simulators to pick yield tables that accurately represent galactic chemistry chemistry. For this purpose, we also show that *Chempy* can be used to dramatically improve elemental abundance predictions of hydrodynamical simulations by plugging tailored best-fit parameters into a Milky Way simulation.


Detecting and Removing Dust from CMB B-modes
-----------------

One of the key science goals for any upcoming Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) survey is the detection of gravitational wave (GW) signals from the very early universe, a key signature of cosmological inflation. Whilst the most promising place to look for these is in the polarized CMB B-mode sky, a major difficulty is that Galactic foregrounds such as dust can easily mimic the inflationary signals. Though foregrounds are typically separated from the CMB via their frequency dependence, this can lead to imperfect subtraction, and has previously led to false 'discoveries' of inflationary GWs. In [Philcox et al. 2018b](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09177), we investigate the extent to which the Galactic dust B-modes' statistical anisotropy can be used to distinguish them from inflationary B-modes, using accurate dust and CMB simulations. We find that such methods are able to distinguish between dust and and gravitational waves close to the resolution level of upcoming experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate how anisotropy statistics can be used to construct an estimate of the dust B-mode map, which could potentially be used to clean the B-mode sky.
