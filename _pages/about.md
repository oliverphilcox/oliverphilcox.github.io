I am a Junior Fellow in the [Simons Society of Fellows](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/), hosted at Columbia University with [Colin Hill](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~jch/) and [Lam Hui](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~lhui/). Previously, I was a doctoral student at Princeton University's Department of Astrophysical Sciences and a visiting graduate student at the Institute for Advanced Study, both located in Princeton, New Jersey. I was advised by [David Spergel](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/david-spergel/) and [Matias Zaldarriaga](https://www.sns.ias.edu/matiasz). Originally from the south of England, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy with [Blake Sherwin](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/bds30), before spending a year in Harvard's Center for Astrophysics with [Daniel Eisenstein](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/daniel-eisenstein). I'm broadly interested in theoretical and statistical cosmology, particularly as applied to Large Scale Structure and the Cosmic Microwave Background, though I have additional interests beyond cosmology, including numerical methods and complex analysis. I have a number of public codes, all available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/oliverphilcox).  

Feel free to [email me](mailto:ohep2@cantab.ac.uk) with any questions!
