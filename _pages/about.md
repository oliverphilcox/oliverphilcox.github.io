I am a PhD candidate at Princeton University's Department of Astrophysical Sciences and a visiting graduate student at the Institute for Advanced Study, both located in Princeton, New Jersey. I work with a variety of people, including [David Spergel](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/david-spergel/), [Matias Zaldarriaga](https://www.sns.ias.edu/matiasz), [Blake Sherwin](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/bds30) and [Zachary Slepian](https://astro.ufl.edu/people/faculty/zachary-slepian/). Originally from the south of England, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy with Blake Sherwin, before spending a year in Harvard's Center for Astrophysics with [Daniel Eisenstein](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/daniel-eisenstein). I'm broadly interested in theoretical and statistical cosmology, particularly as applied to Large Scale Structure and the Cosmic Microwave Background, though I have additional interests in using modern statistics and galactic chemical evolution. I have a number of public codes, all available on my [Github](https://github.com/oliverphilcox).
