I am an Assistant Professor in Physics at [Stanford University](https://physics.stanford.edu/), affiliated with both the [Kavli Institute for Astrophysics & Cosmology](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) and the [Leinweber Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://sitp.stanford.edu/).

Previously, I was a Junior Fellow in the [Simons Society of Fellows](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/), hosted at Columbia University with [Colin Hill](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~jch/). Originally from England, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy with [Blake Sherwin](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/bds30), before spending a year in Harvard's Center for Astrophysics with [Daniel Eisenstein](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/daniel-eisenstein). I was then a doctoral student at Princeton University's Department of Astrophysical Sciences and a visiting graduate student at the Institute for Advanced Study. I was advised by [David Spergel](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/david-spergel/) and [Matias Zaldarriaga](https://www.sns.ias.edu/matiasz).

I'm broadly interested in theoretical, statistical, and observational cosmology, particularly as applied to galaxy surveys and the Cosmic Microwave Background. With Mikhail Ivanov and Marko Simonovic, I won the 2024 [New Horizons Prize](http://breakthroughprize.org/News/83) in Physics.

I have written a brief guide to the [Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure](/assets/pdf/eft_intro.pdf), and have a number of public codes on my [GitHub](https://github.com/oliverphilcox).
