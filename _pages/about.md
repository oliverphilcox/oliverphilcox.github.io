I am a graduate student at Princeton University's Department of Astrophysical Sciences, located in New Jersey, US, where I work with a variety of people, including David Spergel and Matias Zaldarriaga. Originally from the south of England, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy with Blake Sherwin, before spending a year in the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian with Daniel Eisenstein. I'm broadly interested in theoretical and statistical cosmology, particularly as applied to Large Scale Structure and the Cosmic Microwave Background, though I have additional interests in using modern statistics to probe galactic chemical evolution. I have a number of public codes, all available on my [Github](https://github.com/oliverphilcox).
